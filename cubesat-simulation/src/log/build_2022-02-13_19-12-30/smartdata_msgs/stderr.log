CMake Warning (dev) in /home/matheuswagner/repos/adaptive-cubesat-adcs/cubesat-simulation/src/build/smartdata_msgs/connext_cmake_module/check_abi/CMakeLists.txt:
  No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
  contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of
  code such as

    project(ProjectName)

  near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required().

  CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first
  line.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Deprecation Warning at /home/matheuswagner/repos/adaptive-cubesat-adcs/cubesat-simulation/src/build/smartdata_msgs/connext_cmake_module/check_abi/CMakeLists.txt:15 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 2.8.12 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.
