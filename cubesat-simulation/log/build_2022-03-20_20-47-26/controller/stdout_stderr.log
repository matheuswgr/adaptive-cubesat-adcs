CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:29 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findeigen3.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "eigen3", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "eigen3" with any
  of the following names:

    eigen3Config.cmake
    eigen3-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "eigen3" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "eigen3_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "eigen3"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
